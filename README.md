# firstproject

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)
  

- I developed a Flutter mobile application that enables users to browse news, track currency exchange rates between EGP and USD, and monitor recent gold prices in EGP.
- The app fetched real-time data from public APIs and presented it in a responsive and user-friendly interface.


For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
