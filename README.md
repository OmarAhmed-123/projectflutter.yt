-Hello, I am Omar Ahmed

-I am interested in the field of information technology, especially the field of cybersecurity, Blue Team (SOC).

-I am currently a student in the Faculty of Science, Ain Shams University, Department of Mathematics, Computer Science Program, Third Year,

-and also a student at the University of the People online, and I am studying the Computer Science program.

-I learned HTML, CSS, and many programming languages such as Python, Java, JavaScript, C++,SQL,and PHP.



-For this Flutter assessment, I developed a mobile application that allows users to browse the latest news, track currency exchange rates between Egyptian Pounds (EGP) and US Dollars (USD), and monitor recent gold prices in Egyptian Pounds. 
-The application featured a home screen with tabs for news, currency exchange rates, and gold prices. 
-I utilized public APIs to fetch real-time data, ensuring that users received the most current information. 
-The news tab displayed a list format with images, titles, and author names, while the currency exchange rates and gold prices tabs showed the relevant data in an easily readable list format.
-I also implemented a manual data refresh feature via a pull-down gesture on the screen, enhancing user interaction and ensuring up-to-date information. 
-Additionally, I aimed to create a responsive and visually appealing UI across different screen sizes and orientations. 
-For the bonus tasks, I enabled users to tap on news items to navigate to a detailed view and integrated a conversion feature for EGP and USD based on current exchange rates. 
-To further enhance the application, I included visual charts to represent historical data for currency exchange rates and gold prices over time.
